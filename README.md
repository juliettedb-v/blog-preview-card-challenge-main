## My process

I started by creating my HTML the best way possible, then I focused on the distribution by checking on the figma file which was really helpful I inmediately notice how easy is to check design instead of a picture. It was a fun experience, not my first time working with figma but this one was easier. I built all my html and put together my styles, it was more fun with a good playlist!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Once again, I'm proud of my basic responsive design

```css
    @media (max-width:640px) {
      .border {
        width: 20rem;
        height: 31rem;
        justify-content: center;
      }

      .card-container{
        width: 20rem;
        height: 31rem;
        justify-content: center;
      }

      .img-container { 
        border-radius: 10px;
      }

      .img-container img {
        width: 17rem;
      }

      .profile-container {
        padding: 4px 24px;
      }


      .attribution {
        padding: 6rem;
      }
    }

```

### Continued development

I will be focusing on CSS Grid now, but I want to keep practicing with these small proyects, so you'll see more!

## Acknowledgments

Taking Platzi's courses really helped me out to understand basic knowledge that I needed for completing this challenge. I know it's helpful for a lot of hispanics out there and I highly recommend it.
